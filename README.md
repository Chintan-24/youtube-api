# youtube-api
YouTube channel data app made using vanilla JS where user enters channel name and it gives channel data and latest videos as output. 
<br><sub><sup>If you are unable to see LogIn Button , It is because the developer has kept this app still in 'testing' so app can be only used by limited number of users.</sup></sub>
